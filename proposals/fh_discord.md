# Florida Hackers Discord Chat 

## Target audience

<!-- Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal? -->
Not only will the discord improve communication for FH Organizers with permission based rooms(The ability to create rooms made for specific eyes only based on roles assigned in discord, which an infinite amount of roles can be assigned to, where rooms can be seen by everyone or a select few depending on assigned role), it also allows a more open community of Florida Hackers to be active on discord from the rest of Florida.

## Community needs

<!-- What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal? -->
When it comes to determing whether or not Discord should be used over Slack, it's important to note that Slack isn't entirely free and has a data limit for messages and files for the free tier(That info can be found here https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115002422943-Message-and-storage-limits-on-the-Free-plan). 

With Discord, Florida Hackers will have the ability to grow its community without the need for limiting the amount of users in the chat. 

Currently the Florida Hackers Slack channel is not as active as it used to be, and we have already surpassed our 10,000 message free limit meaning that older messages are getting deleted over time. We only have 1.2 GB left of file storage left. The last message made on our general chat was on the day May 30th.As of Wednesday, August 29th we only hit 2 daily active users with the all time high being attributed to August 22nd with 3 daily active users. 

Surely the Florida Hackers community is more than just 2-3 daily active users, therefore I find it vital that we swtich to discord as a platform in order to grow a successful community! 

## Resources

Discord and support of FH
<!-- How will you obtain those resources? -->
With approvial of this proposal we can move forward

Thanks Chris Rodriguez for this comment 

"Discord provides it's own invitation management with the ability to create a permanent invite link. Should Florida Hackers choose to apply for partner status it would also allow for the server to have a branded link that acts as a permanent invite as well, something along the lines of https://discord.gg/floridahackers" 
## Media

<!-- How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project? -->
Endorsing the existence of a Florida Hackers discord at every FL hackathon starting with ShellHacks will help the community grow significantly.
<!-- What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content? -->
Create a pull request to change the florida hackers site to have a discord invite link
## Timeline

<!-- Develop a rough timeline for your propsal. -->
Upon approval of proposal, so time is relative here

1. A few hours to create the discord server and the structure of the server
2. 1 or 2 days afterwards to create pull request to change the florida hackers site to have the discord invite link
3. After setup and creation, as well as the addition of the new changes to the site. Market the switch from Slack to Discord constantly
   - Posting to the Florida Hackers facebook
   - and have every individual hack club endorse the new discord
4. At the date of every hackathon in florida, display invite link for discord for raising awareness of our community chat

In total, creating the discord with proper permission set, as well as updating the FH site should only take 3 days maximum. Afterwards marketing and endorsement should be year round.
